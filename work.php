            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>Steele Clarke Smith III wanted to redesign his personal website by making it more modern as well as using a dark color scheme.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p>It was tricky editing Wordpress because I was unfamiliar with the location of the files. Having to use Firebug to edit things before adding styles was beneficial because editing styles directly into Wordpress felt slow.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>The website was created with Wordpress. HTML and CSS were used to style extra content the Wordpress theme could not supply out of the box.</p>

            <p>Build a tool for users to be able to add, delete and read online articles from a database.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p>Using content from a database and manipulating it.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>Using PHP and Javascript I was able to get id numbers of content and perform any action with them.</p>

            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>Build a website for a fictional consulting company.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p>This was a project created by myself for practice so it was difficult to create a website without content. I had to look up many consulting website's for inspiration for what content to put as well as desing choices.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>I created a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. It uses a lot of lorem ipsum for most of the content, but headers note what type of content would go there.</p>

            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>Build a pomodoro application with Angular.js.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p>Having just learned Angular.js I thought it would be good practice to create an application with it. I had trouble formatting the clock for the pomodoro, but figured it out by the end.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>Angular.js helped in displaying the timer for the pomodoro, but for the most part use pure javascript.</p>

            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>Build a quiz using Javascript. I created this after relearning Javascript and making a project so what I learned would stick.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p>I had problem with the scope at times as well as organizing the code. I went through many iterations to clean up the code.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>I finished the dynamic quiz, which would instantly change to the next question by clicking a button.</p>

            <p>Build a application that can filter through a search with Angular.js.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p>There wasn't much trouble building this. Only thing that was time consuming was writing up the JSON data for it.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>I built it using Angular.js to display all the JSON data and also be able to filter searches by album and year. I am still working on this adding more filters to it.</p>
